# User Interface Software and Technology

The HCI community has a long history of innovation in user interface software and technologies, but there are few surveys or review of all of this research. This book attempts to summarize much of this knowledge, providing a living online textbook for UX designers, researchers, and design-literate developers to learn from and leverage this ever-expanding body of knowledge.

I host the book [on my UW faculty web page](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/user-interface-software-and-technology).

I hope you enjoy! If you find something to fix or improve, file an issue on this repository.
