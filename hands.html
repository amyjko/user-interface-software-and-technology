		<h1>Hands</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>

		<p>
			Thus far, we have discussed two forms of input to computers: <a href="pointing.html">pointing</a> and <a href="text-entry.html">text entry</a>.
			Both are mostly sufficient for operating most forms of computers.
			But, as we discussed in our chapter on <a href="history.html">history</a>, interfaces have always been about augmenting human ability and cognition, and so researchers have pushed far beyond pointing and text to explore many new forms of input.
			Part of the motivation to explore these new boundaries has come from new visions.
			For instance, in 1991, Mark Weiser, who at the time was head of the very same Xerox PARC that led to the first GUI, wrote in Scientific American about a vision of <em>ubiquitous computing</em> (<a href="">Weiser 1991</a>).
			In this vision, computing would disappear, become invisible, and become a seamless part of everyday tasks:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			Hundreds of computers in a room could seem intimidating at first, just as hundreds of volts coursing through wires in the walls did at one time. But like the wires in the walls, these hundreds of computers will come to be invisible to common awareness. People will simply use them unconsciously to accomplish everyday tasks... There are no systems that do well with the diversity of inputs to be found in an embodied virtuality.
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			Within this vision, input must move beyond the screen, supporting a wide range of embodied forms of computing.
			And researchers have deeply explored this vision.
			We'll begin by focusing on input techniques that rely on hands, just as pointing and text-entry largely have: physically touching a surface, using a pen-shaped object to touch a surface, and moving the hand or wrist to convey a gesture.

		<h2>Touch</h2>

		<p>
			Perhaps the most ubiquitous and familiar form of hand-based input is using our fingers to touch screens.
			The first touch screens originated in the mid-1960's.
			They worked like modern touchscreens worked: they consisted of an insulator panel with a resistive coating.
			When a conductive surface such as a finger made contact, it closed a circuit, flipping a binary input from off to on. It didn't read position, pressure, or other features of a touch, just that the surface was being touched.
			Resistive touch screens came next, and rather than using capacitance to close a circuit, it relied on pressure to measure voltage flow between X wires and Y wires, allowing a position to be read.
			In the 1980's, HCI researcher <a href="https://www.billbuxton.com/">Bill Buxton</a> (my academic grandfather it turns out) invented the first multi-touch screen while at the University of Toronto, placing a camera behind a frosted glass panel, and using machine vision to detect different black spots from finger occlusion.
			This led to several other advancements in sensing technologies that did not require a camera, and in the 1990's, multi-touch screens launched on consumer devices, including handheld devices like the Apple Newton and the Palm Pilot.
			The 2000's brought even more innovation in sensing technology, eventually making multi-touch screens small enough to embed in the smartphones we use today.
			(You can see a more detailed history in this <a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/from-touch-displays-to-the-surface-a-brief-history-of-touchscreen-technology/">nice ArsTechnica feature on the history of multi-touch</a>.)

		</p>

		<p>
			The HCI research community was not only central in advancing multi-touch technology to commercial readiness, but it has also been responsible for pushing touch further.
			Some of this work has invented new types of touch sensors.
			For example, researchers have worked on materials that allow touch surfaces to be cut into arbitrary shapes and sizes other than rectangles (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2501988.2502048">Olberding et al. 2013</a>).
			Some have worked on touch surfaces made of foil and magnets that can sense bending and pressure (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2380116.2380180">Rendl et al. 2012</a>), or thin, stretchable, transparent surfaces that can detect force, pinching, and dragging (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2380116.2380182">Sugiura et al. 2012</a>).
			Others have made 3-dimensional spherical touch surfaces (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1449715.1449729">Benko et al. 2008</a>) and explored using <em>any</em> surface as a touch screen using depth-sensing cameras and projectors (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2047196.2047255">Harrison et al. 2011a</a>).
		</p>

		<p>
			Other researchers have explored ways of more precise sensing of <em>how</em> a touch screen is touched.
			Some have added speakers to detect how something was grasped or touched (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2501988.2501989">Ono et al. 2013</a>), or leveraged variations in the resonance of people's finger anatomy to recognize different fingers and parts of different fingers (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2047196.2047279">Harrison et al. 2011b</a>), or used the resonance of surfaces to detect and classify different types of surface scratching (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1449715.1449747">Harrison and Hudson 2008</a>), including through fabric (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2047196.2047235">Saponas et al. 2011</a>).
			Depth cameras can also be used to detect the posture and handedness of touch (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2380116.2380177">Murugappan et al. 2012</a>).
			All of these represent new channels of input that go beyond position, allowing for new, richer, more powerful interfaces.

		</p>

		<p>
			Modern touch screens still focus on single-user interface, only allowing one person at a time to touch a screen. Research has explored many ways to differentiate between multiple people using a single touch-screen.
			One approach is to have users sit on a surface that determines their identity, differentiating touch input (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/502348.502389">Dietz and Leigh 2001</a>).
			Another approach uses wearables to differentiate users (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2984511.2984564">Webb et al. 2016</a>).
			Less obtrusive techniques have successfully used variation in user bone-density, muscle mass, and footwear (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2380116.2380183">Harrison et al. 2012</a>), or fingerprint detection embedded in a display (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2501988.2502021">Holtz and Baudisch 2013</a>).

		<h2>Pens</h2>

		<p>
			In addition to fingers, many researchers have explored the unique benefits of pen-based interactions to support handwriting, sketching, diagramming, or other touch-based interactions.
			These leverage the skill of grasping a pen or pencil that many are familiar with from manual writing, which is often taught in school.
		</p>

		<p>
			Some of these pen-based interactions are simply replacements for fingers.
			For example, the Palm Pilot, popular in the 1990's, required the use of a stylus for it's resistive touch-screen, but the pens themselves were plastic.
			They merely served to prevent fatigue from applying pressure to the screen with a finger and to increase the precision of touch during handwriting or interface interactions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Researchers have explored new types of pen interactions that go beyond more precise touching.
			For example, some techniques explore a user using touch input with a non-dominant hand, and pen with a dominant hand (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1866029.1866036">Hinkley et al. 2010</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2380116.2380156">Hamilton et al. 2012</a>), affording new forms of bi-manual input that have higher throughput than just one hand.
			Others have investigated ways of using the size of a pen's head to add another channel of input (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1449715.1449745">Bi et al. 2008</a>), or even using a physical pen barrel, but with a virtual head, allowing for increased efficiency through software-based precision and customization (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2380116.2380159">Lee et al. 2012</a>).
		</p>

		<p>
			Other pen-based innovations are purely software based.
			For example, some interactions improve handwriting recognition by allowing users to correct recognition errors while writing (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1166253.1166304">Shilman et al. 2006</a>).
			Others have explored techniques for interacting with large displays for sketching and brainstorming activities (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/502348.502353">Guimbretière et al. 2001</a>).
			Researchers have developed interactions for particular sketching media, such as algorithms that allow painting that respects edges within images (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1449715.1449742">Olsen, Jr. and Harris 2008</a>) and diagramming tools that follow the paradigms of pencil-based architectural sketching (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1449715.1449741">Zelenik et al. 2008</a>).
			More recent techniques use software-based motion tracking and a camera to support six degree-of-freedom sub-millimeter accuracy (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3126594.3126664">Wu et al. 2017</a>).

		</center>

		<h2>Gestures</h2>

		<p>
			Whereas touch and pens involve traditional <a href="pointing.html">pointing</a>, gesture-based interactions involve recognizing patterns in hand position or movement.
			Some gestures still recognize a gesture from a time-series of points in a 2-dimensional plane, such as the type of multi-touch gestures such as pinching and dragging on a touchscreen, or symbol recognition in handwriting or text entry.
			This type of gesture recognition can be done with a relatively simple recognition algorithm (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1294211.1294238">Wobbrock et al. 2007</a>).
		</p>

		<p>
			Other gestures rely on 3-dimensional input about the position of fingers and hands in space.
			Some recognition algorithms seek to recognize single hand positions, such as when the user brings their thumb and forefinger together (a pinch gesture) (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1166253.1166292">Wilson 2006</a>).
			Researchers have developed tools to make it easier for developers to build applications that respond to in-air hand gestures (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025508">Krupka et al. 2017</a>).
			Other techniques try to model hand gestures using alternative techniques such as Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2807442.2807480">Zhang and Harrison 2015</a>), radio frequencies (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2984511.2984565">Wang et al. 2016</a>), the electromagnetic field pulsed by GSM in a phone (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2642918.2647380">Zhao et al. 2014</a>),  or full machine vision of in-air hand gestures (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2642918.2647373">Colaço et al. 2013</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2642918.2647373">Song et al. 2014</a>).
			Some researchers have leveraged wearables to simplify recognition and increase recognition accuracy. These have included sensors mounted on fingers (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2984511.2984558">Gupta et al. 2016</a>), movement of a smartwatch through wrist rotations (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2984511.2984574">Zhang et al. 2016</a>), while walking (<a href="ttps://doi.org/10.1145/2984511.2984563">Gong et al. 2016</a>), or while being tapped or scratched (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2984511.2984582">Laput et al. 2016</a>).
		</p>

		<h2>Hand Tracking</h2>
		<center>

			<small>A glove used to faciliate hand tracking with cameras. Credit: (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1531326.1531369">Wang et al. 2009</a>)</small>
		</center>
		<p>
			Gesture-based systems look at patterns in hand motion to recognize a set of discrete poses or gestures.
			This is often appropriate when the user wants to trigger some action, but what about tasks in 3D that require pointing or spatial manipulation?
			Hand tracking systems are better suited for these tasks because they treat the hand as a continuous input device and estimate the hand’s real-time position and orientation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most hand tracking systems use cameras and computer vision techniques to track the hand in space.
			These systems often rely on an approximate model of the hand skeleton, including bones and joints, and solve for the joint angles and hand pose that best fits the observed data.
			Researchers have used gloves with unique color patterns, shown above, to make the hand easier to identify and to simplify the process of pose estimation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1531326.1531369">Wang et al. 2009</a>).
		</p>

		<p>
			Since then, researchers have developed and refined techniques using depth cameras like the Kinect for tracking the hand without the use of markers or gloves (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2047196.2047269">Wang et al. 2011</a>, <a href="#oberweger">Oberweger et al. 2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2897824.2925965">Taylor et al. 2016</a>, <a href="#mueller">Mueller et al. 2017</a>).
			Commercial devices, such as the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com">Leap Motion</a> have been developed that bring hand tracking to computers or virtual reality devices.
			These tracking systems have been used for interaction on large displays (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2807442.2807489">Liu et al. 2015</a>) and haptic devices (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2661229.2661257">Long et al. 2014</a>).

		</p>

		<p>
			For head-mounted virtual and augmented reality systems, a common way to track the hands is through the use of positionally tracked controllers.
			Systems such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, use cameras and infrared LEDs to track both the position and orientation of the controllers.
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>
			Because all of these input techniques use hands, few are accessible to people with severe motor impairments in their hands or people lacking hands altogether.
			In the next chapter, we will discuss techniques that rely on other parts of a human body for input, and therefore can be more accessible to people with motor impairments.
